## Code Quality Notice

This project was **entirely vibe coded** 🎨

What does that mean?
- The code was written quickly and intuitively
- It prioritizes functionality over perfection
- It's not a showcase of best practices or code architecture
- Some shortcuts were taken to get things working

## But...

**It has been human validated and tested** ✅
- The Erlang C formulas are mathematically correct
- The calculations produce accurate results
- The UI works as intended
- The app has been tested and verified to function properly

## What This Means For You

**Don't look too much into the code** 👀

- This is a working tool, not a code review candidate
- The focus is on the mathematical concepts and user experience
- Code quality improvements are welcome but not the priority
- If it works, it works 🤷

## Use At Your Own Risk

While the calculations are validated, this tool is provided as-is for educational and demonstration purposes. Always verify critical capacity planning decisions with your own calculations and testing.

**TL;DR**: Vibe coded, human tested, mathematically sound. Don't judge the code too harshly - it's functional! 🚀
